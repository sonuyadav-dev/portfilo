<h2>👨‍💻 PROJECTS :</h2>

- <b>Thermal Performance Comparison of IC Packages</b>
  - Self-Initiated Project | July 2025 – Present 
● Modeled QFN, BGA, and Flip Chip packages in SolidWorks to analyze geometric 
differences 
● Estimated thermal resistance and heat flow using datasheet values and hand 
calculations 
● Created Excel-based graphs comparing heat dissipation profiles under simulated 
workloads 
● Demonstrated understanding of thermal paths, die attach impact, and package-level limitations 
- <b>Mechanical Analysis Lab Simulation</b>
  - Academic Project | Spring 2025 
● Conducted mechanical testing on polymer-metal composites under variable thermal 
loading 
● Used regression and Excel tools to evaluate failure points and deformation 
characteristics 
● Applied design of experiments (DoE) to analyze material response patterns  <b><i></b></i>
- <b>Modular Sensor Housing for Embedded Platform</b>
  -Texas State Robotics Club | Aug 2024 – May 2025
● Designed and prototyped sensor casing for an embedded robotics project 
● Considered thermal dissipation, vibration damping, and mechanical reliability in housing 
design 
● Led a team of 6 students through iterative prototyping and material selection



<h2>📺LEADERSHIP & INVOLVEMENT  </h2>

Founder & President – Texas State Robotics Club 
Aug 2024 – Present 
● Established and led interdisciplinary team focused on robotics, sensors, and embedded 
systems
